# Asset allocation using Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical Risk Parity
This is a quick attempt at asset allocation.
While PCA can be used to construct a portfolio, its use over here only to denoise the covariance matrix.
Risk Parity is the concept where portfolio weight is distributed such that the risk of assets are the same. For example, higher risk assets receive lower weight.
Hierarchcial Clustering is useful in allocating portfolio weight for Risk Parity, because it is explainable (and visual), data driven, considers covariance between assets.

## Future developments:
1. add more assets
2.
